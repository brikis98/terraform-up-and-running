    I've written a new book! It's called <em>Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery</em>. It's a hands-on guide to
    software delivery—that is, all the processes, tools, and techniques that are required to run software in production
    and maintain it on an ongoing basis—and DevOps, one of the methodologies used today to make software delivery
    vastly more efficient. The early release of the ebook is available now on O'Reilly; if you prefer to wait for the
    print version, you can pre-order it now on Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

    Check out Yevgeniy Brikman's podcast interview with Software Engineering Radio on Infrastructure as Code best
    practices. The discussion covers similarities and differences between conventional software engineering and
    code-driven infrastructure; factoring code into modules; layering; terraform code organization for micro-services;
    releases and tagging; code reviews; unit testing infrastructure; deployment of infrastructure; ownership and code
    structure models; and open source and re-usable libraries.

    This talk from HashiConf 2018 is a concise masterclass on how to write infrastructure code. I share key lessons
    from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork while creating and maintaining a library of over
    300,000 lines of infrastructure code that's used in production by hundreds of companies. Come and hear our war
    stories, laugh about all the mistakes we’ve made along the way, and learn what Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Go
    look like in the wild.

    This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 where I introduce the work we've been doing at Gruntwork with Terraform Modules.
    I explain how modules work, how to design modules so they are highly configurable and reusable, and how to write
    automated tests for your Terraform code. Most importanly, I show you how you can use modules to build your entire
    tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure code—in minutes.

    This talk is a very quick intro to Docker, Terraform, and Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS). In just 15 minutes,
    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.
