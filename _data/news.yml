    This talk is a very quick intro to Docker, Terraform, and Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS). In just 15 minutes,
    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.
